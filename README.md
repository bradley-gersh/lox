# The Lox Programming Language

This repository represents my time working through Bob Nystrom's book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) as a learning
exercise. All of the code is essentially verbatim from that text and does not
represent my own work.

For the up-to-date version, see Nystrom's [repo](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/).
